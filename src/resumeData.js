Then I create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (i.e. a first version of the product) that the client and I agree on, or that I use to adjust the set course. \n 3. I will then hone and sharpen the solution to cut to the core of the requirements, \n 4. At the same time, I ensure that the end user finds palpable, positive value out of the solution (through user interviews, surveys, questionnaires, etc.).",
